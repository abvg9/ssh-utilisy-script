# ssh-utilisy-script
Script that makes an ssh connection to the hosts that we want. This should receive as input the list of hosts (ip or name) and authenticates us inside them to make an ssh connection. This script also needs a file that must be called pass, which contains the key of the hosts in question. It should be noted that this must be used in known networks with maximum reliability.
